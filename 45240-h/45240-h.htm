    <h2>
      MY CREED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW, this is the
      simple, living faith of a humble heart and mind,
    </p>
    <p>
      Drunk up from the storm-brewed Western streams, breathed in <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with
      the prairie wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My paints are crude and my pictures rude, but if some worth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they
      show
    </p>
    <p>
      Which those may see who have thoughts as free, the rest may <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let
      them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold that the things which make earth good may work most <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harm
      in use
    </p>
    <p>
      If the wit of men heed not the line 'twixt temperance and abuse,
    </p>
    <p>
      For speech or mood, or drink or food may be a curse at will,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, rightly weighed, they only aid the cup of life to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold that the silent sea and plain, the mountain, wood, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are better haunts for the feet of men than the streets of the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roaring
      town,
    </p>
    <p>
      And that those who tread for the price of bread in the thronging <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hives
      of toil
    </p>
    <p>
      Will stronger grow with the more they know of the kiss of the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virgin
      soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold that our sons should learn to love, not gods of gold and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greed,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the virile men of brain and brawn who served our country's <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need,
    </p>
    <p>
      And should more delight in a clean-cut fight, stout blade and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courage
      whole,
    </p>
    <p>
      That the morbid skill of a critic's drill in the core of a sin-sick <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Three stars that shine on the trail of life can make man's <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathway
      bright,
    </p>
    <p>
      And one is the strength of the living God, that stands in his <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart
      upright,
    </p>
    <p>
      And one is a noble woman's love, on which his heart may lean,
    </p>
    <p>
      And one is the sight of his country's flag, to keep his courage <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows the balm of the summer's calm or the chords of the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blizzard's
      hymn
    </p>
    <p>
      And finds not God in blast and breeze, his sense is strangely dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he whose ear is attuned can hear the very planets sing
    </p>
    <p>
      That the soul of man, by a God-wrought plan, is the heir of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creation's
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Who feels the joy of the golden days with her who shares his <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mood
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sun-washed wastes of the prairie hills or the breaks of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the
      tangled wood;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has won the fate of a steel-true mate, real comrade, friend <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
      wife,
    </p>
    <p>
      He tastes the kiss of Elysian bliss in instant, earthly life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Who sees the gleam of the Stars and Stripes, on land or sea <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displayed,
    </p>
    <p>
      Atilt in the reek of the battle-smoke or aloft o'er the marts of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trade&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless his veins are the sluggish drains for the blood of a craven race.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He will gain new life for a better strife, whatever the odds he <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is the rede and the homely creed of one who has spelled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it
      forth
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rivers' sweep and the splendors deep of the stars of the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardy
      North;
    </p>
    <p>
      To some, I ween, it may seem but mean; too short, too blunt, too plain,
    </p>
    <p>
      But if those I touch who have felt as much, it will not have been <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
      vain.

      While the Great Dipper, pinned to the Pole Star,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Swings low in the dome of the North

    <p>
      And, faint through the dark, sounds the prairie wolf's bark

    <p class="indent5">
      Or a snake from the weeds rustles forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And the darkness that chokes like a vapor
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Is thronged with the visions which come
    </p>
    <p>
      Of children and wife and the dear things of life

      That peopled the lost cabin home.

      Calls us up to our labors again.

      THE GIRL OF THE YANKTON STOCKADE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES, it's pretty,
      this town. And it's always been so;
    </p>
    <p>
      We pioneers picked it for beauty, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the far-rolling bluffs; mark the trees, how they hide
    </p>
    <p>
      All its streets, and, beyond, the Missouri, bank-wide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Swinging down through the bottoms. Up here on the height
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the college. Eh, sightly location? You're right!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It has grown, you may guess, since I've been here; but still
    </p>
    <p>
      It is forty-five years since I looked from this hill
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, and saw in the stockade down there
    </p>
    <p>
      Our women and children all gathered at prayer,
    </p>
    <p>
      While we, their defenders, with muskets in rest
    </p>
    <p>
      Lay waiting the Sioux coming out of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They had swept Minnesota with bullet and brand
    </p>
    <p>
      Till her borders lay waste as a desert of sand,
    </p>
    <p>
      When we in Dakota awakened to find
    </p>
    <p>
      That the red flood had risen and left us behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we rallied to fight them,&mdash;Sioux, Sissetons, all
    </p>
    <p>
      Who had ravaged unchecked to the gates of Saint Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it strange, do you think, that the women took fright
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning, and prayed; that men, even, turned white
    </p>
    <p>
      When over the ridge where the college now looms
    </p>
    <p>
      We caught the first glitter of lances and plumes
    </p>
    <p>
      And heard the dull trample of hoofs drawing nigh,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the rumble of thunder low down in the sky?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Such sounds wrench the nerves when there's little to see;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed madness to stay, it was ruin to flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, handsome and fearless as Anthony Wayne,
    </p>
    <p>
      Our captain, Frank Ziebach, kept hold on the rein,
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a bugle his voice made us stiffen and thrill&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand steady, boys, steady! And fire to kill!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So the most of us stayed. But when dangers begin
    </p>
    <p>
      You will always find some who are yellow within.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a few such, who concluded to steer
    </p>
    <p>
      For the wagon-train, parked in the centre and rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They didn't stay long! But you've heard, I dare say,
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the girl who discouraged their running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What, no? Never heard of Miss Edgar? Why, sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dakota went wild with the praises of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      As sweet as a hollyhock, slender and tall,
    </p>
    <p>
      And brave as the sturdiest man of us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      By George, sir, a heroine, that's what she made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her spirit blazed out in the Yankton stockade!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The women were sobbing, for every one knew
    </p>
    <p>
      She must blow out her brains if the redskins broke through,
    </p>
    <p>
      When into their midst, fairly gasping with fright,
    </p>
    <p>
      Came the panic-struck hounds who had fled from the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They trampled the weak in their blind, brutal stride,
    </p>
    <p>
      Made straight for the wagons and vanished inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up rose Miss Edgar in anger and haste
    </p>
    <p>
      And grasped the revolver that hung at her waist;
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked to the wagon which nearest her lay,
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrenched at the back-flap and tore it away,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then aiming her gun at the fellow beneath
    </p>
    <p>
      She held it point-blank to his chattering teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back to your duty," she cried, "with the men!
    </p>
    <p>
      Go back, or you'll never see sunrise again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think, because only the women are here,
    </p>
    <p>
      You can skulk behind skirts with your dastardly fear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Get out on the ground. Take your gun. About, face!
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't look around till you're back in your place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he minded; what's more, all the others did, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      That girl cleared the camp of the whole scurvy crew,
    </p>
    <p>
      For a pistol-point, hovering under his nose,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was an argument none of them cared to oppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet so modest she was that she colored with shame
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys on the line began cheering her name!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's all; just an echo of old border strife
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sights on your gun were the guide-posts of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harsh times breed strong souls, by eternal decree,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can breast them and win&mdash;but it's always struck me
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Lord did an extra good job when He made
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Edgar, the girl of the Yankton stockade.

    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Though her breath is a thick-drawn moan,

    <p>
      And a length behind is the straining stride

      "Did ye think to win to the Bijou Hills,

    <p>
      He has slung the chief to the saddle-bow,

    <p class="indent5">
      Triced up in his own raw-hide,

    <p class="indent5">
      I was hammered, lathed, and mandrelled, stock and plate,

      I was gauged and tested, bayonet to heel,

    <p class="indent5">
      Then shipped for service, twenty in a crate.

    <p class="indent5">
      Hi!&mdash;dough-boys, you haven't forgot

    <p>
      The click of my tumblers shifty

    <p class="indent5">
      And the kick of the butt when I shot?

      I was nothing too light on your shoulder,

      You were glad when you stacked me o' nights,

    <p class="indent10">
      From the thousand-yard scratch

    <p>
      If you'd only hold straight on the sights&mdash;old sights!

    <p>
      My trusty old Buffington sights!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In oil-soaked chests at Watervliet I've laid,

    <p class="indent5">
      I have rusted in Vancouver through the rains,

    <p>
      I have scorched on Fort Mohave's baked parade,

      And caked with sand at Sedgwick on the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For I led every march on the border,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And I taught every rookie to fight;

    <p>
      Though he'd curse me in close marching order,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Lord!&mdash;he'd hug me on picket at night

    <p>
      As he thought of the herd-guard at Buford
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When Sitting Bull swooped within reach,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And 'twas every man's life,

    <p class="indent10">
      It was bullet and knife

      Had my cartridges jammed in the breech&mdash;lock breech!

      In my solid block, hammer-lock breech!

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who lashed the Modocs from their lair
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      With Wheaton in the Tule Lava Bed;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was I who drove Chief Joseph to despair
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When I streaked the slopes of Bear Paw with his dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For I was a proof most impressive&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The Springfield the infantry bore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To redskins with spirits aggressive

    <p class="indent5">
      That peace is more healthful than war;
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed them on Musselshell River
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And again, yet more plain, at Slim Butte;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They were plucky as sin
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But they had to come in
    </p>
    <p>
      When they found how the Springfield could shoot&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Shoot, shoot!
    </p>
    <p>
      How my blue-bottle barrel could shoot!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I was Vengeance when, with Miles through trackless snow,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The "fighting Fifth" took toll for Custer's fall;
    </p>
    <p>
      I was Justice when we flayed Geronimo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I was Mercy to the famished horde of Gall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I was slow-plodding and steady;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Not hot, like the carbine, to raid,
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he found trouble too ready
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      He was glad of his big brother's aid;
    </p>
    <p>
      For sometimes he'd scatter the outposts,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then wait, if the foe proved too stout,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Till, at "Front into line!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      It was business of mine
    </p>
    <p>
      While the infantry volleyed the rout&mdash;rout, rout!
    </p>
    <p>
      While I cleared out the village in rout!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But those years have sped; long silent are my lips;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Now my sturdy grandson rules the host I knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      And a drab-clad army trusts his five-shell clips
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As of old the blue-clad held my one shot true.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, my dotage takes solace of glory
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From my turbulent youth and its scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As vivid with valorous story
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As the isles of the far Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the steel-jacket smokeless is sovereign

    <p class="indent5">
      And I'm proud of my name on his crest,

    <p class="indent10">

      A GARRISON CHRISTMAS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW, all you
      homesick rookies who are blue on Christmas Day,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though bunked in pleasant barracks, come listen to my lay!
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're stationed snug at Flagler, Leavenworth, or Hampton Roads,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the postman three times daily brings your Christmas cheer in loads,
    </p>
    <p>
      What ground have you for kicking? You would glorify your fate
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd been in old Fort Buford on Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a bunch of squatty cabins built of cottonwoods and clay
    </p>
    <p>
      With roofs of sod and sedge-grass and windows stuffed with hay,
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the winter blizzards came howling overhead
    </p>
    <p>
      And we couldn't reach the timber, we burned our bunks, instead,
    </p>
    <p>
      While, camped around the gullies, lay five hundred Sioux in wait;
    </p>
    <p>
      That's how we stood at Buford on Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We were out beyond the border a thousand miles or more,
    </p>
    <p>
      A wilderness of drifting snows behind us and before;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a bunch of U. S. doughboys, hollow-eyed from march and fight,
    </p>
    <p>
      For you bet we all kept busy with Sitting Bull in sight,
    </p>
    <p>
      And our old buzz-saw he'd captured never let us sleep too late
    </p>
    <p>
      When he used it as a war-drum around Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember well that morning, it was twenty-four below,
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bright sun striking crystals from the endless fields of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had finished with our breakfast of beans and bacon-fat,
    </p>
    <p>
      When someone cried, "Look yonder, along the bluffs! What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked, then cheered like demons. The mail-guard, sure as fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      A welcome sight, I tell you, on Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They ploughed in through the snow-drifts across the barrack-yard,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their fur caps rimmed with hoar-frost, their horses breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bore orders from headquarters, but we soldiers bade them hail
    </p>
    <p>
      Because they'd brought us, also, our sacks of Christmas mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had never hoped till springtime to have that precious freight;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it strange it raised our spirits on Christmas, '68?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We crowded in a corner around old Sergeant "Jack"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A Santa Claus in chevrons with a mail-bag for his pack&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with horse-play, yells, and laughter we greeted every flight
    </p>
    <p>
      As he called the names and fired them their bundles left and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some there came no tokens, but they kept their faces straight
    </p>
    <p>
      And smiled at others' fortune on Christmas, '68.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom Flint!" A woollen muffler from his sister back in Maine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James Bruce!" His father'd sent him a silver watch and chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hans Goetz!" A flute and song-book from the far-off Baltic's shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "George Kent!" A velvet album from his folks in Baltimore.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how we cheered the pictures from the girls in every State
    </p>
    <p>
      To their sweethearts in the army, on Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fred Gray!" A sudden silence fell on that noisy place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fred lay in the foot-hills with the snow above his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his bunkie loosed the package of its wrappings, one by one&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a Bible from his mother, with a blessing for her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the hardest heart was softened as we thought of our deadmate
    </p>
    <p>
      And that lonely, stricken mother on Christmas, '68.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sergeant raised the shadow as he shouted, "Jerry Clegg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In hospital was Jerry with a bullet through his leg&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gayest lad in Buford&mdash;-and we plunged out through the drifts
    </p>
    <p>
      To take his package to him, forgetting our own gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas a green silk vest from Dublin, and, bedad, it sure was great
    </p>
    <p>
      To hear old Jerry chuckle on Christmas, '68!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it went, with joke and banter&mdash;what a romping time we had!
    </p>
    <p>
      The redskins in the coulées must have thought we'd gone clean mad,
    </p>
    <p>
      For they started popping bullets at the sentinels on guard
    </p>
    <p>
      And we had to stop our nonsense, and sortie good and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was daily routine&mdash;always got it, soon or late&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If we hadn't, we'd felt lonely on Christmas, '68.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So I'm here to tell you rookies who are kicking on your lot
    </p>
    <p>
      That you don't know service hardship as we got it, served up hot,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Philippines are easy and Hawaii is a snap
    </p>
    <p>
      When compared to fighting Injins over all the Western map,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, next time you start to growling when your mail's an hour late,
    </p>
    <p>
      Just recall the boys at Buford, on Christmas, '68!

    <p class="indent10">
      Of the automatic ways
    </p>
    <p>
      That the experts have devised for spillin' gore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Cycle squadrons, motor vans,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      All fixed up on modern plans
    </p>
    <p>
      For a rapid transit, quick installment war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Now, that sort of thing may go
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When you have a thoughtful foe
    </p>
    <p>
      Who will stick to graded roads with all his forces,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But when we were boys in blue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Playing cross-tag with the Sioux,
    </p>
    <p>
      We were satisfied to get along on horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Oh, the horses, sleek and stout
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When the squadrons started out,
    </p>
    <p>
      How they pranced along the column as the bugles blew the "Trot!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They might weaken and go lame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But they'd never quit the game,
    </p>
    <p>
      And they'd bring us back in safety if they weren't left to rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When there came a sudden tack
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In the travois' dusty track
    </p>
    <p>
      And we knew the reds were headin' for the timber and the rocks,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With the infantry and trains
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Thirty miles back on the plains,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the horses were the boys that got the knocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Oh, the horses, roan and bay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Without either corn or hay,
    </p>
    <p>
      But a little mess o' dirty oats that wouldn't feed a colt;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Who could blame 'em if they'd bite
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Through the picket-ropes at night?
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man or horse is hungry, ain't he bound to try and bolt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When the trail got light and thin
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the ridges walled us in,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the flankers had to scramble with their toes and finger-nails,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      While the wind across the peaks
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Whipped the snow against our cheeks,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the horses had to suffer for the badness of the trails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Oh, the horses, lean and lank,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With the "U. S." on their flank
    </p>
    <p>
      And a hundred-weight of trumpery a-dangle all around;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      How they sweated, side by side.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When the stones began to slide
    </p>
    <p>
      And they couldn't find a footing or an inch of solid ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But they'd stand the racket right
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Till the redskins turned to fight
    </p>
    <p>
      And up among the fallen pines we heard their rifles crack;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Hi!&mdash;the three-year vet'rans stormed
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      While the skirmish lines were formed
    </p>
    <p>
      At the snub-nosed little carbines that they couldn't fire back!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the horses, standing there
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      With their noses in the air&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      How they kicked and raised the devil down among the tangled trees!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They didn't mind the shooting,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But they'd try to go a-scooting
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got a whiff of redskin on the chilly mountain breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Still, I've not a word of blame
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For those horses, just the same;
    </p>
    <p>
      A yelping Injun, daubed with clay, he isn't nice to see.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And I ain't forgot the day
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      When my long-legg'd Texas bay
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't scared enough of Injuns not to save my life for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      I was lyin' snug and low
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      In a hollow full of snow
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hostiles flanked the squadron from a wooded ridge near by,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And, of course, the boys, at that,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Sought a cooler place to chat,
    </p>
    <p>
      But they didn't know they'd left me with a bullet in my thigh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But the redskins understood&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Bet your life they always would!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they came a-lopin' downward for this short-hair scalp of mine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      While I wondered how I'd be
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "Soldier a la fricassee,"
    </p>
    <p>
      For I didn't know my Texan hadn't bolted with the line,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Till I heard a crunchin' sound,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And when I looked around,
    </p>
    <p>
      With the reins against his ankles, there that blaze-face rascal stood!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      He was shiverin' with fright,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But he hadn't moved a mite,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he'd never learned to travel till I told him that he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And he stayed, that Texan did,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Till I'd crawled and rolled and slid
    </p>
    <p>
      Down beside him in the hollow and the stirrup-strap could find,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And I somehow reached the saddle
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And hung on&mdash;I couldn't straddle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      While he galloped for the squadron with the Sioux strung out behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Oh, the horses from the range,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They've got hearts; it isn't strange
    </p>
    <p>
      If they raise a little Hades when the drill gets hot and fast;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But I'd like to see a chart
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Of the automobile cart
    </p>
    <p>
      That will save a man on purpose when the shots are singin' past.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Now, the boys in blue, you bet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Earn whatever praise they get,
    </p>
    <p>
      But they're not the only ones who never lag,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      For the good old Yankee horses,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      They are always with the forces
    </p>
    <p>
      When the battle-smoke is curling round the flag!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And I don't believe the men
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Who make drawings with a pen
    </p>
    <p>
      Can ever build a thing of cranks and wheels
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That will starve and work and fight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Summer, winter, day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like that same old, game old horse that thinks and feels.

      A KHAKI KICK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ACK there in
      Washington, people may stare,
    </p>
    <p>
      Easy-chair officers sputter and swear,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bureaucrats legislate&mdash;what do we care?
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the ranks we don't follow the styles;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's health to the General, Nelson A. Miles!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been readin' in the papers and I'm feelin' pretty mad
    </p>
    <p>
      At the shabby sort of treatment that a game old soldier's had.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the soldier I'm referrin' to, who's so surprisin' game,
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Miles, Lieutenant General&mdash;I guess you've heard the name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the pointers that a twelve-year duty sergeant hasn't got
    </p>
    <p>
      On the secrets of the Service, are a quite extensive lot;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he may make observations, while a-wearin' out his shoes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Not just in strict accordance with the War Department's views.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I've seen some bits of service of a somewhat stirrin' brand
    </p>
    <p>
      When the West was callin' lusty for a civilizin' hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      And, myself, I've had some practice in that missionary work
    </p>
    <p>
      With the men who did the business, from the buttes to Albuquerq'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They've sent some stunnin' strategists, so history records,
    </p>
    <p>
      To show the noble red man how the Nation loves its wards,
    </p>
    <p>
      And some was politicians, and some was soft of heart,
    </p>
    <p>
      And some was full of ginger, but couldn't make a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man who knew his business as the king-bird knows the hawk;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who started with the rifle and finished with the talk;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who wouldn't stop for bluffin' when he once got started right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was him I'm tellin' you about&mdash;you bet he came to fight!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I know he's no West Pointer&mdash;I've a notion, what is more,
    </p>
    <p>
      That it isn't only Pointers who may-know the game of war,
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he's a little partial to the medals on his chest
    </p>
    <p>
      He's got a darned good right to be; he earned 'em in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For I've follered him in winter through those blamed Montana snows
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hills was stiff as granite and the very air was froze,
    </p>
    <p>
      And seen him ridin' out in front to lead the double-quick
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lines went into action on the banks of Rosebud Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I've lurched across the Painted Plains, my temples like to burst,
    </p>
    <p>
      And seen men suckin' out their veins to quench their burnin' thirst,
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sky a blazin' furnace and the earth a bakin' sea,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was there beside us&mdash;and was just as dry as we.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, hang these army politics, when jealousy and spite
    </p>
    <p>
      Can rob a veteran of his praise, his dearest, hard-earned right!
    </p>
    <p>
      There's just one kind of officer enlisted men can like&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind who keeps his bearings when the shots begin to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's the kind that Miles has been; he never ducked or flinched;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always in the mix-up when the lines of battle clinched;
    </p>
    <p>
      He's whipped out Rebs and redskins and he's made some Dagos dance,
    </p>
    <p>
      And he's good for lots more fightin' if he ever gets the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here's the moral to this talk&mdash;I'll ask no price, but thanks:
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles may not have a stand-in, but he's solid with the ranks!

      SERGEANT NOONAN EXPLAINS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>AMES Noonan,
      private, 'B' Troop, made sergeant on the field
    </p>
    <p>
      For leading charge on hostiles, compelling them to yield."
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the way the record reads, but, sure, it isn't so;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye mind, I'm Sergeant Noonan and I guess I ought to know!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll tell ye how it happened, dead straight, without no frills.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd tracked a Cheyenne war-band clean through the Blacksnake Hills,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till, on the march one mornin', they jumped us from the right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hundred bucks in war-paint, well armed and full of fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd fifty men in column&mdash;no time to close a rank&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We yanked our horses sideways and fired by the flank,
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though we volleyed through 'em and dropped the foremost ones,
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest came on like devils, right up against our guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now half our boys were rookies who'd never smelt a fight;
    </p>
    <p>
      The yappin' Cheyenne war-whoop just turned 'em blue with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started breakin' column and first we veterans knew,
    </p>
    <p>
      The troop had gone to blazes and let the redskins through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeants clubbed their carbines, the Captain prayed and swore;
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't stop the rookies; they wouldn't stand for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a bullet caught my mustang and ploughed him underneath
    </p>
    <p>
      And he bolted toward the hostiles with the bit between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinks I, "Here's good-bye, Jimmie; but I'll make these heathen grunt,"
    </p>
    <p>
      So I grabbed my Colt and opened as we sailed into their front.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they cleared a passage for me and I couldn't trust my eyes

    </p>
    <p>
      Then I turned and, there behind me, all strung out along my trail,
    </p>
    <p>
      Came the boys of "B" Troop, ridin' like a sizzin' comet's tail,
    </p>
    <p>
      With their horses at the gallop and revolvers poppin' gay
    </p>
    <p>
      For they thought I'd led a rally when my mustang ran away!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's the way it happened, in brief, without no frills,
    </p>
    <p>
      That day the Cheyennes jumped us among the Blacksnake Hills,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is why I claim the chevrons that I'm sportin' on my sleeve
    </p>
    <p>
      Was won by my old mustang and dead against my leave.

    </p>
    <p>
      Through thickets, woods, and sere uplands,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their weary pathway shows;
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward some far fort of logs and stakes
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep hidden in the willow brakes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Right onward still it goes
    </p>
    <p>
      Persistently, an unblazed track,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bent from the cheerless bivouac
    </p>
    <p>
      Of some poor, prairie Indian band
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose chill and flimsy tepees stand
    </p>
    <p>
      Half buried in the snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what of costly merchandise
    </p>
    <p>
      That wealth may covet, commerce prize,
    </p>
    <p>
      Can these adventurers wring
    </p>
    <p>
      From that ill-fed, barbarian horde
    </p>
    <p>
      As seems to them a meet reward
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the risk and toil and pain
    </p>
    <p>
      They've suffered on the winter plain
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid their journeying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, wealth enough is garnered there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not of gold or jewels rare,
    </p>
    <p>
      To rouse the white man's longing greed
    </p>
    <p>
      And send his servants forth with speed
    </p>
    <p>
      To lay the treasure bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trinkets cheap these traders brought
    </p>
    <p>
      The savages have dearly bought,
    </p>
    <p>
      Persuaded guilelessly to pay
    </p>
    <p>
      A ten times doubled usury
    </p>
    <p>
      In furs of beavers and of minks,
    </p>
    <p>
      Of silver fox and spotted lynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all their rich and varied store
    </p>
    <p>
      Of peltries, gathered from the shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood, the prairie, and the hill
    </p>
    <p>
      By trapper's art and hunter's skill,
    </p>
    <p>
      The traders' heavy packs now fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A journey far those furs must go
    </p>
    <p>
      From these wild fastnesses of snow,
    </p>
    <p>
      By travois, pack, and deep bateau;
    </p>
    <p>
      By keel-boat, sloop, and merchantman
    </p>
    <p>
      Till half a hemisphere they span,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere they will lie, at last, displayed
    </p>
    <p>
      By boulevard and esplanade
    </p>
    <p>
      In Europe's buzzing marts of trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      These marten skins, so soft and warm,
    </p>
    <p>
      May wrap some Russian princess' form
    </p>
    <p>
      And shield her from the Arctic storm
    </p>
    <p>
      That howls o'er Kroonstadt's bay;
    </p>
    <p>
      That robe, a huge black bear which, dressed,
    </p>
    <p>
      May cloak some warrior monarch's breast
    </p>
    <p>
      As, gazing o'er the battle crest,
    </p>
    <p>
      He sees the foemen's legions pressed
    </p>
    <p>
      In panic, from the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not the destinies
    </p>
    <p>
      Which may, perchance, beyond the seas,
    </p>
    <p>
      Await these rare commodities,
    </p>
    <p>
      That chiefly signify,
    </p>
    <p>
      Though king and knight and princess fair
    </p>
    <p>
      Should leave the coteaus stripped and bare
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pride to gratify.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this; that in the storm to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through cloudy gloom, through pale moonlight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men still press along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not hiding, as the wolf and hind,
    </p>
    <p>
      From blinding snow and bitter wind
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, like the Indian, crouching low
    </p>
    <p>
      Above a brush-fire's feeble glow
    </p>
    <p>
      But, vigorous and strong,
    </p>
    <p>
      Hasting their bidden task to close
    </p>
    <p>
      Whate'er obstructions interpose
    </p>
    <p>
      And parrying Fortune's adverse blows
    </p>
    <p>
      Right gaily, with a song.

      Is one of strength and fear.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic of his virile powers

      Shall change your desert wastes to bowers,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your nakedness to shade;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall stretch broad, rustling ranks of corn
    </p>
    <p>
      Along your stony crests forlorn
    </p>
    <p>
      And wheat-fields, dappling in the sun,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where your mad autumn fires have run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trails your bison made
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall grow beneath his hurrying feet
    </p>
    <p>
      To highway broad and village street,
    </p>
    <p>
      Along whose grassy sides shall sleep
    </p>
    <p>
      Meadows and orchards, fruited deep;
    </p>
    <p>
      Homesteads and schools and holy fanes
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove that all these fertile plains
    </p>
    <p>
      Are turned by God's eternal plan
    </p>
    <p>
      To serve the onward march of man,

      Which sweeping down the vale of time
    </p>
    <p>
      With gathering strength and hope sublime
    </p>
    <p>
      Is never checked nor stayed.

    <p>
      Lost in the endless waste of sands,

      Lies, like a blot of gray and brown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nacozari, a desert town.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long through its narrow street
    </p>
    <p>
      Children play in the dust and heat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Naked of limb and dark of face,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lithe as fawns in their careless grace,

    <p>
      Chattering shrill in a half-caste speech

      Cut through the thick adobe wall,

    <p>
      Or in the narrow belts of shade
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there by the flat roofs made,

    <p>
      Lounge the indolent, swarthy men,
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving sluggishly now and then
    </p>
    <p>
      Better to scan their dicing throws
    </p>
    <p>
      Under their low-tipped sombreros.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for the most, content to lie
    </p>
    <p>
      Drowsing the listless hours by,
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching, each, as the thin, blue jet
    </p>
    <p>
      Curls from his drooping cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, from the dawn's first flush

    <p>
      When the mass is said in the morning hush
    </p>
    <p>
      Till fall of eve, when the vesper's peal
    </p>
    <p>
      Calls the faithful again to kneel,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing rouses the quiet place,
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulled in the desert's hushed embrace,
    </p>
    <p>
      Save when out of the distance dim,
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the far horizon's rim,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden a purring whisper comes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising swift, like the throb of drums,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the iron track which stretches forth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight as a lance from south to north,
    </p>
    <p>
      Quivers and sings in the mighty strain
    </p>
    <p>
      From the grinding wheels of a through-bound train
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for a space, as the whistle screams,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nacozari awakes from dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women and children, boys and men
    </p>
    <p>
      Stream to the station platform then,
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager to gaze from its long plank walk,
    </p>
    <p>
      With gesturing arms and rapid talk,
    </p>
    <p>
      At the huge machine like a comet hurled
    </p>
    <p>
      From the mystical zone of the outer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was on one summer's day,
    </p>
    <p>
      While the land in its noontide slumber lay
    </p>
    <p>
      With never a living creature near
    </p>
    <p>
      Save a lizard, perhaps, by a cactus spear
    </p>
    <p>
      Basking himself in the fervid heat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, high aloft, like a pirate fleet,
    </p>
    <p>
      A flock of vultures on lazy wing
    </p>
    <p>
      Circling wide in a watchful ring,
    </p>
    <p>
      That into the street of the desert town
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, slow freight came rolling down,
    </p>
    <p>
      Laden with goods of Northern yield
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mexican mine and town and field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumbling in with failing speed
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to rest like a. tired steed,
    </p>
    <p>
      With the mogul engine's dusty flank
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by the massive water-tank,
    </p>
    <p>
      As if it longed, like a living thing,
    </p>
    <p>
      To quench its thirst at the cooling spring
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the thousand-foot artesian well,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunk through the desert's crusted shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it stopped with a grinding jar
    </p>
    <p>
      Rattling back from car to car,
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the engine-cab swung clear
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus Garcia, the engineer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sooted and grimed to his finger-tips
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lilt of a song on his smiling lips,
    </p>
    <p>
      For he was handsome and young and strong
    </p>
    <p>
      And love was the theme of his murmured song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he passed his engine by
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanning its length with a practiced eye,
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching a polished slide-valve here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or there, a shaft of the running-gear,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which done, he turned in a boyish mood
    </p>
    <p>
      To a group of children who, gaping, stood
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side of the track, too wonder-bound
    </p>
    <p>
      To move a limb or to make a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into their midst Garcia sprung
    </p>
    <p>
      And a chubby lad to his shoulder swung,
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, laughing, clutched at his corded neck
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a sailor tossed on a rocking deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps to the Mexican engineer
    </p>
    <p>
      The child suggested a vision dear
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a little boy of his very own
    </p>
    <p>
      In a white-washed cottage at Torreon,
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dark-eyed mother who, day by day,
    </p>
    <p>
      Told beads for her husband, far away,
    </p>
    <p>
      And watched, as the trains steamed forth and back,
    </p>
    <p>
      For his mogul engine along the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But only a moment, with swinging feet,
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby perched on his lofty seat,
    </p>
    <p>
      For suddenly down by the cars in rear
    </p>
    <p>
      There rang a shriek of unbridled fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia turned, in amaze looked back;
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of men from the railroad track
    </p>
    <p>
      Were rushing away in a frantic race
    </p>
    <p>
      As if they had looked on a demon's face,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as he turned, the cause was plain
    </p>
    <p>
      For half-way back in the standing train
    </p>
    <p>
      A flame licked out from a box-car's side,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yellow and spiteful, a handbreadth wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      His cheek grew pale, but his lips still smiled
    </p>
    <p>
      As he slipped from his shoulder the startled child,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor even forgot in his haste to place
    </p>
    <p>
      A good-bye kiss on the upturned face;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang to the street with a bound and gazed
    </p>
    <p>
      Intent, at the spot where the fire blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely a glance was enough to tell
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a car which he knew full well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Shipped in bond by a fast freight line,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bound for a great Sonora mine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled to the roof and loaded tight
    </p>
    <p>
      With closed-tiered boxes of dynamite;
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough, if its deadly strength found vent,
    </p>
    <p>
      To rock the land like a billowed tent,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweeping the town from the desert sand
    </p>
    <p>
      Clean as the palm of an opened hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he do, the engineer,
    </p>
    <p>
      Face to face with this mortal fear?
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn, as the rest, to the desert wide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mad with dread, for a place to hide,
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the town and its helpless folk
    </p>
    <p>
      Doomed to death at a single stroke?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! Though only a peon born
    </p>
    <p>
      Heart like his might a king adorn!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Waving his arms to his frightened crew,
    </p>
    <p>
      Such as remained, a scattered few,
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia uttered a warning shout&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undile! Vamos!" ("Run! Get out!")
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaped to his engine waiting there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Opened the throttle, released the air,
    </p>
    <p>
      And started the jets for the sand to run
    </p>
    <p>
      On the glassy rails where the drivers spun,
    </p>
    <p>
      Till, biting the steel with a spurt of fire
    </p>
    <p>
      Sputtering back from each grinding tire,
    </p>
    <p>
      The monster conquered its straining load
    </p>
    <p>
      And, gathering speed on the curveless road,
    </p>
    <p>
      It rolled from the town and left it whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like death torn loose from a stricken soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But looking backward with stern-set face,
    </p>
    <p>
      Throttle gripped in a firm embrace,
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia goaded his panting steed
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever and ever to faster speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing still if the blow should fall
    </p>
    <p>
      It would shatter the village wall from wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now from the sides of the car behind,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanned by its flight through the rushing wind,
    </p>
    <p>
      Burst the flames in a lashing sheet
    </p>
    <p>
      Peeling the paint with its fervid heat,
    </p>
    <p>
      Vomiting sparks like a fiery hail
    </p>
    <p>
      On the cars that rocked in its lurid trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the mogul, in giant flight,
    </p>
    <p>
      Swaying drunkenly left and right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Strained to the race, while the rails it trod
    </p>
    <p>
      Thundered behind it, rod by rod;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in its cab, foredoomed, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting death like a man of stone,
    </p>
    <p>
      Stood Garcia, his feet braced wide
    </p>
    <p>
      To the pitch and plunge of the engine's stride,
    </p>
    <p>
      With never a frown to show he knew
    </p>
    <p>
      Regret for the task he was there to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly a mile had his wild train fled
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the desert straight ahead,
    </p>
    <p>
      When a flare of light to his vision came
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the world were engulfed in flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it fell on his closing eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the great, white light of Paradise;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, in the roar which smote him there,
    </p>
    <p>
      Too deep for a mortal ear to bear,
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard but the Heavenly trumpet-roll
    </p>
    <p>
      Blown clear to welcome a hero's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, if any have won to rest
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fair, green land of the ever blest
    </p>
    <p>
      By earning their right therein to dwell,
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus Garcia deserved it well,
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the blast that strewed his train,
    </p>
    <p>
      Torn in fragments, along the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only his soul went forth to meet
    </p>
    <p>
      The final call at his Master's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is that to-day, alone,
    </p>
    <p>
      In a white-washed cottage at Torreon,
    </p>
    <p>
      A brown-skinned woman with sad, dark eyes
    </p>
    <p>
      Looks on her child at his play, and sighs,
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing well she will hark in vain
    </p>
    <p>
      For her husband's step at the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or watch, as the trains steam back and forth,
    </p>
    <p>
      For his mogul engine out of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is that when evening falls,
    </p>
    <p>
      Draping the dull adobe walls
    </p>
    <p>
      Fold on fold in its tender mist,
    </p>
    <p>
      Purple and blue and amethyst,
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nacozari kneels down to pray
    </p>
    <p>
      At the vesper call from the chapel gray,
    </p>
    <p>
      Many an orison of love
    </p>
    <p>
      Is wafted up to the stars above
    </p>
    <p>
      For the peace of Jesus Garcia's soul;
    </p>
    <p>
      He who had saved the village whole
    </p>
    <p>
      By the utmost gift which a man can give&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Life, that his fellow men might live.

      A CHRISTMAS LETTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ear miss:
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For this pink stationery
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me; it's all I could find
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In Buck Dalton's store at the Ferry,
    </p>
    <p>
      So I took it&mdash;I hope you won't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For it's Christmas good wishes I'm sending,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Though in words not the best ever slung,
    </p>
    <p>
      To you, where the Tiber is wending.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From me, on the banks of the Tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you've forgotten the morning
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      When your car of the Overland Mail
    </p>
    <p>
      Broke loose on a curve, without warning,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And was ditched by the spread of a rail?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I was herding near by in the valley,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And I pulled out your father and you,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I found that your name, Miss, was Sallie,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And&mdash;well, I remember. Do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You were there for five hours at least, Miss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Then the whistle, a smile, a last word,
    </p>
    <p>
      And you rolled away to the East, Miss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      While I galloped back to the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You back to your world and its beauties.
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      New York, Paris, Rome, and all those,
    </p>
    <p>
      I, back to a cowboy's rough duties
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In sunshine and rainstorm and snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night I'm alone in the shack here
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      On my quarter-square Government claim,
    </p>
    <p>
      While coyotes are yelping out back here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      You'd be scared, Miss, I guess, by the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight is white on the river,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the long, frozen miles of the plain
    </p>
    <p>
      Seem to shrink in the north wind and shiver
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And wish it was summer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It's different where you are, I reckon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Leastways from the books it must be,
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the green hills of Italy beckon
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the Tiber sings down to the sea;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the red roses always are climbing
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the air smells of olives and pines,
    </p>
    <p>
      And at evening the vesper bells' chiming
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Floats up toward the far Apennines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You like it, no doubt, and you'd never
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      See beauties that nature can hold
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the snow lies in drifts on the river
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the prairies are empty and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow I wouldn't forego it
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For all of those soft, southern lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I breathe it and feel it and know it;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It grips me as if it had hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars in the night, how they glisten!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      The plains in the day, how they spread!
    </p>
    <p>
      There's room to stand up in, and listen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And know there's a God overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when the summer is coming
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And the cattle start out on the trails,
    </p>
    <p>
      And you hearken at dawn to the drumming
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of prairie-hens down in the swales.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, Italy simply ain't in it!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But, Miss, here I'm talking too free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excuse me; my thoughts for a minute
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Got sort of the better of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just about Christmas I started;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To me, it was only a name
    </p>
    <p>
      Till that day when we met, talked and parted,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      But since it has not been the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      For you gave me a new kind of notion
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Of the countries and people and such
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trails that lie over the ocean&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      I guess we don't differ so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christmas is chuck full of spirit
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That everywhere under the sun
    </p>
    <p>
      Warms up anyone who comes near it
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And fills them with good-will and fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So I want you to know from this letter
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That the time by the train wreck with you
    </p>
    <p>
      Made me know all humanity better
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      And like the whole bunch better, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And I hope, if it seems like presuming
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That a letter shall come to your door
    </p>
    <p>
      In the land where the roses are blooming
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      From me, on the Tongue's icy shore,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll forgive, Miss, an uncultured party
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      In the spirit of Christmas, and take
    </p>

      These thanks and good wishes, all hearty,

      THE COYOTEVILLE PEACE MEETING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E held a peace
      convention in Coyoteville last night,
    </p>
    <p>
      A reg'lar Haygue Tribunal fer order, law, an' right,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fer we'd about concluded that fightin' come too free
    </p>
    <p>
      An' municipal conditions wasn't all they ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad" Sykes had been to Denver an' Blake to Omaha,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' they come back a-preachin' of the sights which they had saw,
    </p>
    <p>
      How no one carried weepons an' folks was nice an' mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      An', compared with them there cities, Coyoteville was wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In Coyoteville the habit of some gentlemen at nights,
    </p>
    <p>
      If they felt in pleasant spirits, was to puncture out the lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in questions dealin' with a social poker game
    </p>
    <p>
      They was prone to draw their irons an' argue with the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All which, from "Dad" Sykes' view-point, an' likewise Mister Blake's,
    </p>
    <p>
      Was morally pervertin' an' the biggest of mistakes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Coyoteville's best people had begun a-takin' pride
    </p>
    <p>
      In makin' her the model of the cattle-countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, we held a meetin' in the Frou-Frou Dancin' Hall;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad" Sykes he played first fiddle an' Blake was there to call&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean that Sykes persided an' Billy wrote it down
    </p>
    <p>
      When motions was perpounded on how to run the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bat" Blarcum broached the idee, supported by a speech,
    </p>
    <p>
      That the closin' of the thirst-joints was the only thing would reach,
    </p>
    <p>
      Since liquor bred dissension which only blood could stop
    </p>
    <p>
      As he knew from observation, though he "never touched a drop!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pierpont Robyn Stebbins arose an' begged to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the road to civic virtue lay quite another way:
    </p>
    <p>
      To punish weepon toters would be the proper feat&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jest confiscate their weepons an' make 'em clean the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bobby Earl was doubtful of Pierpont Robyn's plan;
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that cleaning roadways would humiliate a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bat" Blarcum felt as Earl did, an' inferred that Stebbins' scheme
    </p>
    <p>
      Was degenerate an' Eastern an' an iridescent dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Pierpont stood up coldly an' stated to the Chair
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mister Earl's opinions would be weighty anywhere,
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he meekly yielded, lest he be crushed indeed
    </p>
    <p>
      By the most substantial leader of the law an' order creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      Now Bobby weighed three hundred an' it somewhat nettled him
    </p>
    <p>
      To be ridiculed in public there by Stebbins, who was slim,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Chairman wouldn't hear him till Pierpont's partner, Drew,
    </p>
    <p>
      Had made some observations about "Bat" Blarcum, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Which last, he said he hated to cast aspersions 'round,
    </p>
    <p>
      But he felt "Bat's" plan of action was very far from sound,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' he questioned these reformers whose reform was brought about
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a hate for rum engendered by the Keeley curin' route.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished; whereat Bobby raised objections an' was pained
    </p>
    <p>
      At the style of Stebbins' language&mdash;an' Bobby was sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Stebbins said the Chairman might be strong an' somethin' more,
    </p>
    <p>
      But he dared not try sustainin' Mister Earl down on the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time indications made it plain to persons there
    </p>
    <p>
      That a spirit of contention was a-breedin' in the air,
    </p>
    <p>
      Fer Drew jumped through a window as Blarcum slowly rose,
    </p>
    <p>
      While Bobby Earl was aimin' fer Pierpont Stebbins' nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The other folks concluded it was gettin' time they went,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' started fer the doorways by unanimous consent,
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Chair came down on Stebbins regardless of the law,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' Blake propelled the Minutes at Mister Blarcum's jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There'll be a bunch of fun'rals in Coyoteville today;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some well-known ex-reformers in the leadin' parts will play;
    </p>
    <p>
      An' Coyoteville's considerin' this lesson o'er an' o'er,
    </p>
    <p>
      That peace may have its battles as well, sometimes, as war.

    <p>
      I am king of my day as he of his, from the swamp to the saw-backed spur,

    <p>
      I've saved the leaguered wagon-train from the scalping-knife and stake;

    <p>
      I have held the lead through the blind stampede in the bison's dust-dimmed
      wake;

    <p>
      By the reeking dives of the placer camp I have killed for a careless jest,

      Away in the dusk of the Arctic night, where the frozen rivers flow

      And the fringed aurora floods and fades on the endless fields of snow,
    </p>
    <p>
      The hardy hunters trust my sights and my spinning bullet's speed

    </p>
    <p>
      She marked 36 on the Yankton gauge,

      Which I reckon you know is some of a stage,

      Well, that's where the widow o' old Buck Slack

      Oncet had a claim an' a drift-wood shack.

    <p>
      Where she lived an' slaved with her young-un pack,

    <p>
      A-wavin' an' yellin' with all her might,

      He had slashed the falls from the long-boat's rim

      Ran straight to the eddy an' clawed her in,

    <p class="indent5">
      An' staggered himself ashore.

    <p class="indent5">
      If a man with his head-piece right,

    <p>
      Fer a half-mile pull through that mill-race tide

    <p class="indent5">
      She reeled like a sawyer snag,

    </p>
    <p>
      An' she whirled around an' shot down stream
    </p>
    <p>
      With the foam from her bow like a cloud o' steam,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      As fast as a red-tail stag.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Lord, the fright in them children's cries!
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      It curdled a feller's blood,
    </p>
    <p>
      Them river men ain't a prayerful race,
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night more'n one sort o' hid his face
    </p>
    <p>
      An' sent up a plea to the Throne o' Grace
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      To guide them through the flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      An' then that gorge sent up a roar
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      That shook the solid ground;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sort that splits yer ears in two

    <p>
      When a side-wheel packet drops a flue

    <p>
      An' blows six b'ilers amongst her crew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      An' cooks them that ain't drowned.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She was breakin' loose like an avalanche,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Slipped free on a mountain side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake Dale turned 'round an' give one look
    </p>
    <p>
      An' read the truth like a printed book,
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bent to his oars till the keel-post shook,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      An' pulled fer the "George's" side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent5">
      An' we hauled her to the rail.

    <p>
      When he'd landed the last one, safe an' sound,

      Jake follered, an' says, as he looked around,

    <p>
      "You fellers fetch out that jug you found,

    <p class="indent5">
      Jake Dale, o' the "Lucky George."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn't no saint with a gilt-edged crown;
    </p>
    <p>
      His language would shatter a church-steeple down;
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd a thirst in his throat that nothin' could drown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      An' a fist like a blacksmith's forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, all the same, he'd a Christian soul
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      If he hadn't the Christian creed,
    </p>
    <p>
      An' a better heart, by a blame long shot,
    </p>
    <p>
      Than some pious folks that brag a lot
    </p>
    <p>
      On savin' their souls, but haven't got

      No time fer their brother's need.

    <p>
      In the twilight dreaming of a happy home to be
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside thy restless waters, sweeping silent toward the sea,
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever in the gloaming while time shall ebb and flow
    </p>
    <p>
      Love will build its castles in the crimson afterglow.
